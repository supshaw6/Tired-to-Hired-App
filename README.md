## "Tired to Hired" Web App

The purpose of this app is to provide an online interface for users to input a record of recent job applications, the status of each application, and chronicle their journey from tired to hired!

Here are the checkpoints I'd like to reach with this project:

1. Develop interface to input the following:

   - company name
   - job title
   - date applied
   - status
   - link to reference job

2. Translate status to a progress bar of some kind to account for milestones like:

   - passed screening
   - passed background check
   - received first interview
   - received second interview
   - skills assessment
   - job offer
   - acceptance or denial

3. Allow for users to log in and track their own progress with the following features:
   - sign up using LinkedIn or Google
   - sign in
   - change password
   - forgot password
   - change username

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
